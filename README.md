# open-logistics-data-au
Utilities and examples for consuming public Australian Open Data related to logistics, transport and GIS

As more agencies commit to provided access to information through open data initiatives, it can often be
difficult to fully exploit them. This repo aims to collect related data sources from different authorities 
and combine key aspects of them into a common format.


## Current Status

The first stage will be to collect all available rest-stop data from Australian state sources. Currently detailed facilities are not included in the derived data but this will be prioritised once all state sources have been initially parsed and the location coordinates populated into a single data set.
